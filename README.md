### Help with Built-in function snippets

* `./src/language/builtins.code-snippets` will be used to defined all available built-in functions in Db2 for i.
* This is used to make writing SQL, and having access to all scalars, easy.
* You can find a PDF reference and a list of built-in functions [on this PDF](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSAE4W_9.6.0/db2/rbafzpdf.pdf), starting at page 287
* We simply need a new snippet object for each function.

### Help with Schemas tool views.

* Each object type in the tree list has a Defintion View (by clicking on the object). Each Definition View exists in it's own folder. For example the table definition exists at `./src/panels/table`. This means other types will get their own folder for their Definition View. Views might be `./src/panels/view` and procedures might be `./src/panels/procedure`.
* Each object type has a class in the `./src/database` folder. For example, the table Definition View has the class `./src/view/table.js` which has all the methods needed to fetch information for that view. You may also add other static methods which could be used for commands specific to the table. Other objects would also get their own class.
* **The best example to work from is `src/panels/view/index.js`.**
